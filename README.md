# Python Web Scraper
This program is an HTML web scraper template made for newegg.ca, which writes scraped data into a Microsoft excel document. 
This web scraper was made to compare CPU prices between AMD and Intel during a store sale. Future plans for this program involve scaling and increasing robustness.
